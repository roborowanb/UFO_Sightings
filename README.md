## Summary
The draw back of this webpage is that the javascript function is built to run whenever the input value has changed. This can be tedious for someone with poor connection and is trying to run multiple filters at one time. Instead of being able to fill in multiple filter values, then run the function, they are forced to run the function every time. Some improvements that could be made to the webpage include having an export button available, allowing the user to filter on the webpage and extract the data that they need into a csv file. Another improvement is if the filters were smart enough to auto populate options that correspond as the user is typing, this would help the user know if there is data available for "toronto" as they are typing.
